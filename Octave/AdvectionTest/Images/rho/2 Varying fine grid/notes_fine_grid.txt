In this test, 
Coarse grid resolution is Nc = 16
Sampling grid resolution is Ns = 256
and fine grid resolution is varied to Nf = 32, 64 & 128. 


Grid grid shows sampling grid.
Red grid shows fine grid on which the final interpolant happens.


It is observed that there is no change in the quality of results.
