In this test, 
Coarse grid resolution is Nc = 32
Fine grid resolution is Nf = 64
Sampling grid resolution is varied to 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048. 


Grid grid shows sampling grid.
Red grid shows fine grid on which the final interpolant happens.

Observations:
1. Quality improves when sampling grid increases. 
2. Size of ripples decreases. 
3. Span of each ripple confines to 3-4 sampling grid and other previous experiments suggests that is has nothing to do with fine grid resolution.
