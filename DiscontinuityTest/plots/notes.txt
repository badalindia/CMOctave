In test 1, discontinuity is right at the grid point. 
In test 2, discontinuity is right at the mid point of the the grid points. 

(in "<test_name>_long" this is observed)
Test 2 is stable, while test 1 gets unstable and attains a state with a little bit of overshoot which grows very slow.


(in "<test_name>_long_success" things are fine)
