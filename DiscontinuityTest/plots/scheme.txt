Finally the scheme that works is as follows: 

We have set of points S = [0, h, 2h, ... , Nh], where (N+1)h = 1
On this set, we have values f(x) and fx(x) (where x lies in S)
which we can use as the piece-wise hermit interpolant H on S. 

we destribute these points into two sets
S1 = {(2n+1)h: n are integers such that 1<= 2n+1 <= N}
S2 = {(2n)h: n are integers such that 1<= 2n <= N}

Let say H1 is a piece-wise hermite interpolant on S1 (only using valyes f(x) and fx(x), for each x in S1)

Let say H2 is a piece-wise hermite interpolant on S2 (only using valyes f(x) and fx(x), for each x in S2)

In every odd-numbered iteration, 
we look for H1.
It it has tendency to overshoot, 
we refined the values
